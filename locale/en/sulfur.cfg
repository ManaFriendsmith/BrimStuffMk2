brimstuff-toluene-from-oil=Toluene byproduct from oil
brimstuff-clobber-bz-chemical-plant=Override burner chemical plant from BZ natural gas

[mod-setting-description]
brimstuff-greenhouse=Adds a basic greenhouse for wood production. Wood is required for creating rubber. Recommend you turn this off if you have another mod that adds greenhouses. Note: the greenhouse will always be enabled regardless of this setting when used with Space Age, for progression-sanity reasons.
brimstuff-waste-treatment=If enabled, various recipes will produce chemical waste which must be disposed of.
brimstuff-krastorio-filter-hell=If enabled, Krastorio dirty water filtration recipes will produce chemical waste instead of clean water. Please note that this will make efficient exploitation of basic ores on waterless planets in K2+SE less viable.

brimstuff-toluene-from-coke=Adds toluene as a byproduct from making coke, charcoal, or phenol. Requires another mod that actually adds coking. This byproduct is free, but increases the complexity of the coke industry. Disabling toluene byproducts does not disable the need for toluene.
brimstuff-toluene-from-oil=Adds toluene as a byproduct from oil processing and cracking. This byproduct is free, but increases the complexity of the oil industry. Disabling toluene byproducts does not disable the need for toluene.
brimstuff-clobber-bz-chemical-plant=BrimStuff and Natural Gas both add a burner chemical plant. The difference is mostly cosmetic, but the BrimStuff chemical plant also has a simpler recipe with many BZ mods enabled. They also have different fluid box connection points, so changing this mid-save can break builds.
